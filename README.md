# Grocery-store-forecast


For this project, we aim to forecast grocery sales for a large retail store in Ecuador, Corporacion Favorita. The scale of such chain stores require that their operations are run with great efficiency; efficiency with regards to stocking of fast moving goods. Stock too little of a particular product and demand won't be met, stock too much and shelves will not be emptied quickly enough. Consider that demand for different products fluctuates in different periods and one can grasp how tight their operations need to be. The forecasts from this project can be used improve retail performance by aiding in restocking of products based on their predicted in different periods such as promotions and holidays seasons
